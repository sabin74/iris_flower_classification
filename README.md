# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

A classic machine learning project to classify iris flowers into three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” using their sepal and petal dimensions.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project uses supervised learning to predict flower species based on four numerical features:  
- Sepal length  
- Sepal width  
- Petal length  
- Petal width

This dataset is a popular beginner-level dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## ðŸš€ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn / Matplotlib (for visualization)

## ðŸ§ª Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
